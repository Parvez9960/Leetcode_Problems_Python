9. Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1






Soultions:
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        temp = x
        rev = 0
        while temp > 0:
            rem = temp % 10
            temp //= 10
            rev = ((rev * 10) + rem)

        if(x == rev):
            return True
        else:
            return False
